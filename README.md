Tyler Nisonoff, Kevin Jian

Started 9/10
2 hours planning.
Lots of hours for implementation.

Ended 9/22

[Respository](https://github.com/duke-compsci308-fall2013/springies_team02.git)

### For team projects, each person's role in developing the project
* For plan:
	* Created basic design layout together
* For implementation 1:
	* Tyler - Object classes, force classes, custom world
	* Kevin - Parser, creating objects, setting environment
* For implementation 2:
	* Tyler - Loading new assemblies and clearing all assemblies, and allowing mouse to move assembly
	* Kevin - Toggle forces, and change playing size

### Any books, papers, online, or human resources that you used in developing the project
* [Box2d](http://www.box2d.org/manual.html#_Toc258082967)
* [Sodamath](http://www.cs4fn.org/alife/images/sodamathspaperfull.pdf)

### Files used to start the project (i.e., the class containing main) and test the project (the class containing TestSuite)
* Main starts file.
* No test files.

### Any data or resource files required by the project (including format of non-standard files)
* Assembly and environment data files in found in assets

### Any information about using the program (i.e., command-line/applet arguments, key inputs, interesting example data files, or easter eggs)
* 'n' will bring up a dialog box where the user can type in the data file and press enter to load it. To load another, just type a new file name in the dialog box and press enter again, or close the original dialog box and press 'n' again to open a new one.

### Any known bugs, crashes, or problems with the project's functionality
* There is a finite number of assemblies that can be loaded within the simulation.

### Any extra features included in the project

### Your impressions of the assignment to help improve it in the future
* Kind of physics heavy, lot of ambiguities regarding that and how the program should function with regards to the example sodaconstructor
