Use factory for this in doFrame()

Multiple assemblies
	N just parses again. C clears all objects except walls
	Problem with creating objects - the ids would be duplicated
		Jgame adds id numbers after as well
		Parser has own hashmap - clear each time

Mouse dragging
	Make mass at x, y of mouse, use distance, sort, use shortest distanced mass, create a spring with the set rest length, so pull/push will work

Toggle forces
	When parsing elements put in default environmental forces in custom world
		Add set default in custom world
	Forces has to be changed into a hashmap, not just list
	Worldmanager.getworld. 
		If in forces, remove
		If not, take from default values map

Change size of walled area
	Just add / subtract 10 to margin, clear old wall, create new walls with new margin
